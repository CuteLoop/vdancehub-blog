We learn to dance by "mirroring" other people's movements or trough our own explorations.
Understanding the symmetries of dance will help us in both tasks.

This is a draft of the first post about dance and symmetries. 
- 1.  the symmetries of partner dancing form a Kleine group
- 2. The symmetries of an infinite squence of patterns form a frietze group.
