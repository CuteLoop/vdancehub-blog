## This dance blog
I enjoy learning about dance and this blog is for sharing interesting thigs I learn along my Journey.
My Journey starts with Partner dancing and social dancing with salsa, cumbia and bachata.

In 2025 I attended my first dance festival, a thrilling experience.
This has not been the only source of inspiration this year. Explorations of Zouk, swing, and salsa casino dance styles that have a lot in common with cumbia and bachata. Make me want to create new steps on each of these dances drawing from connections within them. Another aha moment this year came from taking a first tap dancing class, Loads of creative impulses came form expressing yourself trough taps and sounds. Last year I had revelations of what it means to connect in a partner dance while learning tango and it is being complemented this year with zouk. Overall I enjoy exploring different aspects of dance and would like to share my findings and hopefully learn form other dancerÂ´s findings.

I have kept a dancing diary which is being redefiend and would love to exchange entries. Writing dance and dance notation is an intriguing topic.
I have a special interest in sharing cool bits of the intersection of dance an Mathematics as well as dance and Physics.drawing
